Welcome to our Final Project! We will add more info here about what our project is about when we get further into development.

Step 1:

	Create the homepage. Greet users to the site, give a short description of the site, and direct them to the Login and Sign up buttons.

Step 2:

	After the user presses the Login and Sign up button, direct them to a page asking for their email and creating a username. Pages are identical except for some text.

Step 3:

	Create a dashboard that shows the calendar for the day, several reminders, and an input for a daily goal.

Step 4:

	Implement a calendar where users can add events.

Step 5:

	Implement a reminder page where users can add reminders
